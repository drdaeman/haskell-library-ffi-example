This illustrates building a shared library (.so) in Haskell and calling it from C and Python.

I wrote nothing by myself, but read and pasted the code from those articles:

- http://www.well-typed.com/blog/30
- http://weblog.haskell.cz/pivnik/building-a-shared-library-in-haskell/
- http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonVsHaskell#Using_both_Python_.26_Haskell_with_ctypes_.28-.3B

I've made sure everything compiles and works as expected on Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 with GHC 7.4.1
from standard Ubuntu repositories. Edit Makefile if you have another version (there's no autoconf,
so no libHSrts-*.so version detection).

Use `make run` to build and run examples.
